My name is Austin Welborn and I was born Deaf.  I graduated with both my bachelors and masters in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Utah in 2009/2010 respectively.  Shortly after graduating, I moved to Albuquerque, NM to work for Sandia National Laboratories for 2 1/2 years then worked at a small start-up company.  After that I decided I wanted to include CS skills and find new jobs that deal with both engineering and computer science.
