My name is Austin Welborn and I was born Deaf.  I graduated with both my bachelors and masters in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Utah in 2009/2010 respectively.  Shortly after graduating, I moved to Albuquerque, NM to work for Sandia National Laboratories for 2 1/2 years then worked at a small start-up company.  After that I decided I wanted to include CS skills and find new jobs that deal with both engineering and computer science.

## Hobbies that I have
*working out
*eating Paleo foods (which only focuses on meats, vegetables, fruits, no grains or sugar/fats)
*watching horror movies
*playing video games
*reading
*playing with my beloved 6 year old daughter

## Interests
*programming
*3D modeling
*cybersecurity (possibly?)
*steampunk
*tattoos

# Programming Background
I have worked with MatLab, AutoLisp, HTML, CSS, Javascript a little, but it wasn't until last quarter when I really worked with C++ in CS165.   My favorite project was probably the final project in CS165 where I created a short rpg game with several puzzles and battles and 3 options for easy, medium, hard.
